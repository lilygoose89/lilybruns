## Startup Storyteller & Community Connector

I help startups share their message with the world and I support talent by bringing together communities.

Focused on brand messaging and content marketing, I use the power of the written word to connect with audiences and build trusted relationships.

An adaptable communicator with high cultural sensitivity, I have lived, studied, and worked in half a dozen countries across five continents.

I’m startup minded, self-motivated, at ease switching hats on the fly, and able to use minimal resources to maximum effect.

To get to know me better professionally, please have a gander at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilybruns/) or enjoy a peek at my [projects](/#projects).

## Oh, you want more?

Fortunately for you, I have given up all semblance of boundaries between my personal and professional life, so here we go…

### Around the world and back again

Born in Jakarta, Indonesia and raised in Chiang Mai, Thailand slash Seagrove Beach, Florida. I was educated in [Gainesville, Florida](http://www.ufl.edu) and then later in [London, England](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/). Just for shits and grins I lived in New York for a bit. Turns out I love to visit but everybody there is obsessed with working so it's a very unhealthy environment for me to be in.

So yes, you may have noticed I have a habit of wandering around a bit (now excuse me real quick while I go update all my security questions).

I've made my home in, to my great surprise, my hometown of Chiang Mai. It's a wonderful place to live and its energy attracts the best kind of people. I don't know if I'll be here forever, but with three cats, it's safe to say I'm probably here for a while.

I'm a third-culture kid, which is a nice way to say I have never fit in but it's ok, I now have excellent communication skills and I'm highly adaptable.

### I dance and I think things… also I talk a lot

If Tyrion Lannister drinks and knows things, then I have a penchant for twirling around on my lanky limbs and engaging in deep, deep nerdiness.

Here is a short list of things that I will happily talk about at length:

* Harry Potter
* The singularity
* The Oxford Comma
* Whether or not pole dancing should be an Olympic sport
* Netflix romcoms
* My cats
* Warehouse communities
* Why coliving is THE BEST for nomads
* The definition of a startup
* Where I would go in the event of a zombie apocalypse
* Whether or not we're living in a simulation
* Whether Trello is an effective productivity tool or not
* Whether Dr Who is sci-fi or fantasy
* What my love languages are
* Thailand's shitty immigration policies and its stateless people problem
* What my favorite anime is
* How Eastern philosophy figured out the whole consciousness thing ages ago and it's cute Western science is finally catching up

Hmm… Let's go ahead and consider this list my brainstorm for forthcoming blog topics. Expect more to come\!

Anyways, in addition to being a thinker and a talker, I have a fun habit of interrupting people, most egregiously with the opening line, "well actually…" ('cause everyone *loves* being corrected, amirite?). I'm working on it, but I was picked on as a child and being a knowitall kind of became my defense mechanism. Sorry, not sorry. We're all works in progress.

### All I want is a giant warehouse for me and my friends

Maybe it was all that not fitting in or maybe it's because I've run away so many times that I'll now forever be chasing the feeling of home (insert thoughtful pause) but I have, as they say, "a thing" for bringing together communities.

Yes, if you have ever had a conversation with me, I am indeed obsessed with startups and content marketing, but I hope my life's work will be nurturing community.

Specifically, I'm working up the courage to ask a bunch of people for a bunch of money so I can buy a giant warehouse (and I already have one in mind because one of my hobbies is phoning up realtors and asking to look at properties as if I totes have millions just lying around) and turn it into some sort of live/work space for creatives or a coliving/coworking.

I lived in a warehouse in northeast London for a year, and I've basically been hooked on the idea ever since. It's brilliant being surrounded by creative, talented people and having 10 of your best friends living next door. I'm a lazy extrovert. I love people, but I just don't like having to go somewhere to be with them.

If that's your jam too, hit me up and let's make something happen. I will also accept a large parcel of land on which to build earthships and treehouses and make all our solarpunk dreams come true.
