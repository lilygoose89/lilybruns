Startup smarts can help anybody. My passion is for the scrappy, innovative, and technologically wondrous world of startups, but the playbooks I’ve developed working in the tech space can be applied to business problems small and large.

If you want to get maximum impact out of your time, effort, and attention, I can help you to think like a startup and focus on doing work that drives results.

### 1.	Craft Better Brand Messages

Having a hard time spelling out why your project is just the best? Feel like your messaging isn’t connecting the way you need it to?

My marketing specialty is helping teams take a step back to explore the value propositions they make – or as I like to call this service, **“helping startups pull their heads out of their asses so they can actually speak to customers.”**

When we’re deep in the throes of creation _and_ simultaneously focused on higher level business strategy _and_ day to day details it’s hard to be objective…

Take a step back and get some clarity so you can understand your brand’s value, craft your identity, and tie in all your messaging and communications in a cohesive, impactful way.

### 2.	Get Ruthless (but Necessary) Feedback

Pretty sure you’ve got something promising on your hands but struggling to figure out the finer details of how it can be improved?

Each of us tends to have a core set of skills we bring to the table but in the resource-strapped context of startups and pilot projects, we’re often asked to wear too many hats at once. This can result in work or products that you’re maybe just not _quite_ sure are awesome all around…

What you need is critical feedback from somebody who _understands the context of your business and your goals_. Somebody who will take the time to understand your end-user and strategic aims before they do a thorough tear-down of your work.

**I’ll give you the tough love you’ve been missing**, and I'll deliver this feedback to you in a way that’s constructive. More importantly, I’ll work with you to craft the step-by-step plan for rolling out improvements in the context of your resource constraints.

### 3.	Create Content That Builds Trust

Wondering why it is you’re even blogging or what the point of all this social media content is?

The modern internet runs on content, but so much of it is noise. Is what you’re creating content that captures and engages, or is it just more garbage for people to tune out?

The point of content marketing is to build trust and cultivate a relationship with your customer. The deal’s simple, you demonstrate your value by providing entertainment or education and in turn, you get goodwill and a slice of attention. Is that deal working out for you?

I’ll help you to frame the big picture of your content strategy and hone in on how to utilize each channel to achieve specific business objectives. Whether it’s your blog, Instagram, videos or even your self-help knowledge base, getting a clearly outlined content strategy will ensure you’re **investing in marketing that actually serves your business.**
